Question: Nested Routing with Persistent Layout in Next.js

Create a Next.js application with the following requirements:

Implement nested routing for a user section with the following routes:

/user/profile

/user/setting

/user/history

All these routes should share a common Header component that contains navigation links (Profile, Setting, History).

The Header component must not re-render when navigating between the pages. Only the page content should change.

Ensure that the navigation feels seamless (SPA-like) using Next.jsâ€™ built-in routing system.

## Steps to start the app
1. Run `npm install` in the root directory.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and start navigating
