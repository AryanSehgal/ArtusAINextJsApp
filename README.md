Question: Nested Routing with Persistent Layout in Next.js
Create a Next.js application with the following requirements:
Implement nested routing for a user section with the following routes:
/user/profile
/user/setting
/user/history
All these routes should share a common Header component that contains navigation links (Profile, Setting, History).
The Header component must not re-render when navigating between the pages. Only the page content should change.
Ensure that the navigation feels seamless (SPA-like) using Next.jsâ€™ built-in routing system.
